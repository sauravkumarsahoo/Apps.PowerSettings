# PowerSettings
PowerSettings is a utility that allows you to quickly change your computer's power mode from the system tray. This is especially useful for systems that do not have a battery and rely on a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for backup power. During a power outage, it can be difficult to conserve energy and extend the runtime of the UPS. PowerSettings provides an easy way to save power and reduce noise by switching to a lower power mode.
